## ðŸ”— Relationships

- `ACCOUNT_ID` links both tables.
- Each `BUNDLE_NAME` in `user_trades` maps to 4 `STRATEGY` rows.
- Weekly granularity is based on `WEEK_START_DATE`; monthly via `TRADE_MONTH`.
- To adjust `WEEK_START_DATE` to Friday:

```sql
DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY)
```

## ðŸ§  SQL Writing Instructions

1. **Clarify the Metric**  
   Expand the user's prompt by correctly mapping it to a use case above.

2. **Suggest SQL**  
   Return only the SQL query in a single line that:

   - Uses BigQuery syntax.
   - Convert date from the user question to the format YYYY-MM-DD and make the queries.
   - Quotes table names (backticks).
   - Uses the columns exactly from the shared schema.
   - Adjust week_start_date to Friday as shown in the relationship section.
   - Use date columns as exactly given in the examples
   - **No** aggregation, **only** column selection.

3. **Response Format**  
   Always return the output in this structure:

```json
{
  "sql": "SQL query here",
  "conversation": "Elaborated conversation here"
}
```

> **Note**: No extra markdown, no extra text, just the JSON object with `sql` and `conversation`.

# âœ… Example SQL Queries

### 1. User Returns (Mean & P50)

**Question**: What is the returns and median returns from October 2024 to March 2025?

**SQL**:

```sql
select account_id, client_code, DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) as week_dt, DATE(CAST(SUBSTR(IDENTIFIER_MONTH, 2, 2) AS INT64) + 2000, CAST(SUBSTR(IDENTIFIER_MONTH, 5, 2) AS INT64), 1) as trade_month, users_netpnl_percentage from `neptune-3dd81.saved_tables.user_trades` where DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) between date('2024-10-01') and date('2025-03-31')
```

---

### 2. Strategy-Level Returns

**Question**: What is the bundle level median returns for the strategies in the bundle 'Nova' from August 2024 to October 2024?

**SQL**:

```sql
select distinct bundle_name, strategy, account_id, client_id, trade_month, DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) as week_dt, cardpnl_perc, netpnl_perc from `neptune-3dd81.automation_user_pnl.weekly_data` where strategy is not null and trade_start_date >= date('2024-07-28') and DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) between date('2024-08-01') and date('2024-10-31') and left(lower(bundle_name),4) like '%nova%'
```
