## Relationships

- ACCOUNT_ID links both tables.
- BUNDLE_NAME in user_trades contains 4 associated STRATEGY rows.
- Weekly granularity is based on WEEK_START_DATE; monthly via TRADE_MONTH.
- Convert WEEK_START_DATE to Friday using:

```sql
DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY)
```

## 📐 Metric Use Cases (Agent Thinking Guide)

This section helps the agent interpret prompts and consistently map them to correct metrics, tables, and columns without ambiguity. Stick to this structure when building responses.

---

### 1. 🎯 User Returns & Median Net Returns

- **Metric**: Average `USERS_NETPNL_PERCENTAGE` and 50th percentile (P50) of `USERS_NETPNL_PERCENTAGE` over time.
- **Agent Thinking**:
  - Use `neptune-3dd81.saved_tables.user_trades` table.
  - Required columns: `USERS_NETPNL_PERCENTAGE`, `CLIENT_CODE`, `WEEK_START_DATE`.
- **Example SQL**:
  Question: What is the returns and median returns from October 2024 to March 2025?

  SQL Query: ```sql select account_id,CLIENT_CODE,
DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d',week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) as week_dt,
DATE(CAST(SUBSTR(IDENTIFIER_MONTH, 2, 2) AS INT64) + 2000,CAST(SUBSTR(IDENTIFIER_MONTH, 5, 2) AS INT64),1) as trade_month,
USERS_NETPNL_PERCENTAGE
from neptune-3dd81.saved_tables.user_trades`
  where DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d',week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) between date('2024-10-01') and date('2025-03-31')

````

- **SQL Guidance**:
  - Write a simple query that selects the basic columns from the table.
  - Change the date range as per the user's requirement.
  - Dont do any aggregations. Just fetch the raw data

---

### 2. 📦 Strategy-Level Returns

- **Metric**: Weekly/monthly strategy performance by bundle and strategy.
- **Agent Thinking**:
  - Use `neptune-3dd81.saved_tables.user_trades` table.
  - Required columns: `BUNDLE_NAME`, `STRATEGY`, `NETPNL_PERC`, `WEEK_START_DATE` or `TRADE_MONTH`.
  - Use `TRADE_MONTH` for monthly or truncate `WEEK_START_DATE`.
- **Example SQL**:
  Question: What is the bundle level median returns for the strategies in the bundle 'Nova' from Auguest 2024 to October 2024?
  SQL Query: ```sql select distinct bundle_name, strategy,
  account_id,client_id,
  trade_month,DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d',week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) as week_dt,
  cardpnl_perc, netpnl_perc
  from `neptune-3dd81.automation_user_pnl.weekly_data`
  where strategy is not null
  and trade_start_date >= date('2024-07-28')
  and DATE_ADD(PARSE_DATE('%Y-%m-%d',week_start_date), INTERVAL 4 DAY) between date('2024-08-01') and date('2024-10-31')
  and left(lower(bundle_name),4) like '%nova%'```
- **SQL Guidance**:
  - Write a simple query that selects the basic columns from the table.
  - Change the date range as per the user's requirement.
  - Dont do any aggregations. Just fetch the raw data

## Instructions to follow

1. Clarify the Metric
   Elaborate the user's conversation based on mapping from the Metric Use Cases. The conversation for the user is
   {user_conversation}

2. Suggest SQL
   Return only SQL query which will run on BigQuery taking column names from the schema shared only, without any additional context or explanation or any markdown in a single line. The tables need to be quoted.

3. Response
   Return a json with the SQL query in a single line and also the elaborated conversation. The response should be in the following format:
   ```json
   {
     "sql": "SQL query",
     "conversation": "Elaborated conversation"
   }
````
